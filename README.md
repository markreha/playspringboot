# A simple Java Spring Boot that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. See the following directions for deploying a Java Spring Boot application to Azure, AWS, Heroku, and Google Cloud.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
  * `npm start`
  * Runs the app in the development mode.
  * Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  * The page will reload if you make edits.

## Building and Testing
1. Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.
2. Test the React App locally by using MAMP: Copy all the files under the buld directory to the MAMP htdocs/[APP_NAME] directory

## Important Fies
* Procfile - start file for both Heroku and AWS Cloud Platforms
* web.config.xml - start file the AWS Cloud Platform

## Deployment to Cloud Platform Instructions

		* The /route should contain the following code:
			* res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html');  
4. Deploy from a Build:
	1. Run a build using the npm run build command.

	3. Click on the Upload and deploy button.
		* Click the Choose file button and select your zip file.
		* Click the Deploy button.
5. Deploy from a GIT CI/CD Build Pipeline:
	1. Configure code and setup build pipeline (if not already completed):
		* Add a buildspec.yml (see example below) to the root of your application code for Node 10 application.
		* Log into AWS and select Services from the main menu.
		* Select the CodePipeline service.
		* Click the Create Pipeline button.
		* Give your pipeline a name (i.e. TestAppPipeline). Click the Next step button.
		* Select GitHub from the Source provider dropdown. Click the Connect to GitHub button and select your repository and master branch. Click the Next step button.

		- NOTE: these steps assume the use of the Google Cloud Shell but an alternative is to download and install the Google Cloud SDK (at https://cloud.google.com/sdk).
	3. Clone the GIT Repository using the 'git clone [GIT REPO URL]' command. Navigate to the root of your project code.
	4. Run the 'npm install' command.
	5. Run the 'npm run build' command (if you make any changes run a 'git pull [GIT REPO URL]' command and run the 'npm run build' command again).
	6. Update the package.json file (you can use the build in Code Editor in the Cloud Shell) with the following changes to the scripts:
		- Update: "start": "serve -s build",
		- Add: "prestart": "npm install -g serve",
	7. Run the 'gcloud app deploy --project [PROJECT ID]' command.
	8. Access the application from the URL noted in the build screen or select the App Engine->Versions menu options from the main Google Cloud page.
5. Deploy from a GIT CI/CD Build Pipeline:
	1. Select Cloud Build from the Google Cloud main menu.
	2. Enable the App Engine Admin API by going to the API's & Services-> Library menu options, search for App Engine Admin API, and enable the API.
	3. Click the Settings menu. Enable App Engine Service account permissions.
	4. Select the Triggers menu. Click the Connect repository button. Select GitHub option. Click the Continue button. Click the Install Google Cloud Build button to enable access to desired repositories for specified projects.
	5. Create a Google Cloud Build file named cloudbuild.yaml and add this to the root of the project in GitHub. See example below.
	6. Update the package.json file (you can use the build in Code Editor in the Cloud Shell) with the following changes to the scripts:
		- Update: "start": "serve -s build",
		- Add: "prestart": "npm install -g serve",
	7. To build and deploy your application:
		- Select the Cloud Build->Triggers menu open options.
		- Either make a change to code in GitHub and select the Cloud Build->Dashboard menu open options or select the Cloud Build->Triggers menu and click the Run Trigger button to start a build and deployment.
